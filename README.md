This script records models from stripchat.com/xhamsterlive.com continuously by exploiting a publically accessible API of the site and agnostic hls-routing.

This script is tested in Ubuntu and with ffmpeg version 4.2.4-1ubuntu0.1. If it functions for other operating systems or ffmpeg binaries is not known.

Before running this script, create "models_followed.txt" file. Inside this file, list the model usernames that you want to be surveilled/recorded separated by newline (capitalisation doesn't matter, rank-ordered list). As configured, this script will record top 8 models inside models_followed.txt that are online.

Stripchat, if you are reading this and don't like it. Please harden your website, break my code :)
